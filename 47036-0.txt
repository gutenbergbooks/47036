WHEN YOU ASK WHY I DWELL HERE DOCILE AMONG THE FAR GREEN HILLS, I LAUGH
IN MY HEART. MY HEART IS HAPPY.

THE PEACH-BLOSSOM WATCHES THE RIVER RUNNING BUT REMAINS CONTENT. THERE
IS A BETTER HEAVEN AND EARTH THAN THE BUSY WORLD OF MEN.

                           I HAVE SEEN A ROAD


I HAVE SEEN A ROAD THAT WANDERS IN GREEN SHADE, THAT RUNS THROUGH SWEET
FIELDS OF FLOWERS. MY EYES HAVE TRAVELED THERE, AND JOURNEYED FAR ALONG
THAT COOL FINE ROAD.

BUT I WILL NEVER REALLY WALK THAT ROAD; IT DOES NOT REALLY LEAD TO WHERE
SHE LIVES.

WHEN SHE WAS BORN, THEY BOUND HER LITTLE FEET WITH LEATHER BANDS; MY
BELOVÈD NEVER WALKS THE ROAD OF SHADE AND FLOWERS.

WHEN SHE WAS BORN, THEY BOUND HER LITTLE HEART WITH LEATHER BANDS; MY
BELOVÈD NEVER LISTENS TO MY SONG.

                           FLOATING NARCISSUS


FADED NARCISSUS, FLOATING DOWN THE RIVER TO TIENOUAN.... IF YOU SEE
THERE A YOUNG GIRL DREAMING, UNDER A CINNAMON TREE THAT HAS BLOSSOMED
TWICE SINCE WE EMBRACED, TELL HER ... I SMELL A FRESH CARNATION TO
REMEMBER HER PERFUME.

                              THE FRIENDS


YOU RODE A YELLOW HORSE, I RODE A WHITE ONE.... HORSES TWO COLORS, BUT
OUR BOYISH HEARTS WERE ONE.

WE RODE TOGETHER THROUGH THE COUNTRY, A PAIR OF PRANCING PEACOCKS ...
OUR JEWELED LONG SWORDS SHINING IN THE SUN, OUR TALL HEADDRESSES
SCARLET, AND OUR PRECIOUS FURS WORTH THOUSANDS ... WE WERE GUESTS OF ALL
FIVE ORDERS OF NOBILITY.

NOW, MY FIERCE TIGER FRIEND HAS CRASHED INTO A TRAP. IT IS FINE TO FACE
FATE NOBLY ... BUT IF MY BRAVE COMRADE IS IN DANGER, WHAT PLEASURE CAN I
FIND IN BEING FREE AND HAPPY?

                            A NEGLECTED WIFE


A WINDOW OPENS AND A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN LOOKS OUT. HER EYES ARE WET AS SHE
LOOKS AT GRASS TURNING GREEN BEFORE HER HOUSE, AT WILLOWS IN NEW LEAF
ALONG THE RIVER. IN TIMES PAST, WHEN SHE LOOKED OUT, SHE SANG.

WHEN YOU OWN A TREASURE YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO KEEP IT. MY FRIEND, YOURS
HAS TWO BEAUTIFUL LEGS: BE CAREFUL, OR IT WILL RUN AWAY!

                        THE POET AND THE DANCERS


HERE, DAY AND NIGHT, THE PRETTIEST WOMEN OF THE EMPIRE ARE DANCING ...
SONGS AND LAUGHTER ECHO FROM THE GOLDEN SCREENS.

WHEN ALL THE OTHERS ARE OVERCOME WITH DRINKING, I PUT DOWN MY WINE. I
TAKE MY BRUSH, I WET THE GOLDEN INK, AND I WRITE SAD POEMS WITH SWAYING
CHARACTERS THAT LOOK LIKE THESE ROSY BODIES STREWN ON A MARBLE FLOOR.

                            I WILL BE ALONE


THIS LAKE AT KUEN-MING, HOW WONDROUS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF HAN! THEN IT
FLOATED A PARADE OF PROUD WAR-JUNKS GAY WITH FLAGS ... NOW IT IS ONLY A
BARE MIRROR AT NIGHT FOR THE SPINNING BOY ... THAT STAR-BOY WHO DOES NOT
FLEE FROM COLD.

BLACK SEED-PODS FROM THE KOUMI BLOW ON IT NOW. THERE ARE LILIES AND
LOTUS-FLOWERS TOO ... BUT SOON THE NORTH WIND WILL RIP AWAY THEIR
LEAVES.

AND I WILL BE ALONE WITH MY UNHAPPINESS.

                         REMEMBER TO WEAR THEM


A SHADOW ON THE WINDOW-SCREEN.... WHO COMES GATHERING MY FLOWERS? SHE
MAY PICK THEM IF SHE WILL, BUT WHAT WILL SHE DO WITH THEM?

THE BEST SPRAYS ARE THERE BENEATH THE EAVES. PICK MORE OF THESE ... AND
REMEMBER, YOU WHO GATHER FLOWERS, WEAR THEM IN YOUR HAIR.

                               WILD GEESE


FAR IN THE NORTHWEST STANDS A HOUSE, HIGH ITS TOWER IN THE CLOUDS.
EMBROIDERED CURTAINS ARE AT THE WINDOWS. THE TOWER RISES IN THREE STEPS,
AND FROM THE TOWER FLOATS A SONG, A SAD SONG WITH A SAD LUTE PLAYING
BESIDE IT. WHO CAN THE SINGER BE?

SURELY IT IS SHE WHO HAS NO HUSBAND LEFT TO HER, NO FATHER LEFT, NO
CHILD. HER SONG FOLLOWS THE WIND; IT RISES AND FALLS. WITH THE SINGING,
SOBBING ... GRIEF IS VICTOR OVER HER STRONG WILL.

SHE DOES NOT SORROW THAT HER LIFE IS SAD, BUT THAT SO FEW CAN UNDERSTAND
THE SORROW IN HER SONG. O, TO FLY LIKE THOSE TWO WILD GEESE, RISING WITH
BEATING WINGS!

LAZILY WAVING A WHITE-FEATHERED FAN I LIE NAKED ... A GREEN DELL IN THE
MOUNTAINS. I HANG MY HAT ON A JUTTING ROCK ... I COOL MY HEAD WITH PINEY
AIR.

                             TO THE EMPEROR


WITH THIS I SEND A MIRROR ... IT IS PURE ROUND AND IT IS CLEAR WHITE, TO
REMIND YOU OF THE MOON WE GAZED AT WHEN WE WERE LAST TOGETHER IN THE
GARDEN.

MAY IT ALWAYS STAY WITH YOU, AND MAY IT STIR SWEET MEMORIES.

BUT I KNOW: BY AUTUMN YOU WILL CAST IT ASIDE FOR SOMETHING NEW, AS YOU
HAVE CAST ASIDE ITS LOVING SENDER.

                       WHEN THE SWALLOWS RETURNED


WHEN THE SWALLOWS RETURNED LAST YEAR THEY MADE THEIR NEST IN THE
EMBROIDERY ROOM. THEY GATHERED CLAY FROM THE FLOWER-GARDEN, AND
SCATTERED DUST OVER HARP AND BOOKS.

WHEN THE SWALLOWS RETURNED THIS YEAR, NO ONE HEARD THEIR TWITTERING
SPEECH. SHE WHO HAD ROLLED UP THE SCREEN FOR THEM WAS THERE NO MORE....
IN THE AMBER TWILIGHT A SOFT-PATTERING RAIN.

                          THE WORLD AROUND US


DREAD LORD, DO NOT WAVE YOUR SCEPTER: IT IS BEJEWELED. DEAR DANCER, DO
NOT WHIRL YOUR SCARVES: THEY ARE ORCHID-FLOWERED. PALE POET, DO NOT
FLAUNT YOUR HEART: IT IS RADIANT WITH LOVE.

OUR WORLD CARES ONLY FOR UNENCHANTED THINGS.

                           YOUNG GIRLS OF OLD


IN A TINY GROVE WITH FLOWERS EVERYWHERE, YOUNG GIRLS OF DAYS GONE BY SIT
LOOKING IN THEIR MIRRORS.

THEY SAY: “SOMETIMES WE THINK THAT WE HAVE GROWN OLD, THAT OUR HAIR IS
WHITE AND OUR EYES NO LONGER CLEAR AS THE NEW MOON.... BUT IT IS NOT
TRUE! OUR MIRRORS ARE BEWITCHED WITH WINTER, AND THEY LIE! IT IS THE
MIRRORS THAT MAKE OUR HAIR LIKE SNOW AND WRINKLE OUR YOUNG FACES! BUT
WICKED WINTER CAN BEWITCH OUR MIRRORS ONLY, NOT OURSELVES.... FOREVER,
WE ARE UNCHANGED.”

                         THE MINIATURE PAVILION


HERE IS THE LITTLE LAKE, HERE THE LITTLE PAVILION OF WHITE PORCELAIN.
THE TINY JADE BRIDGE CURVES ... THE BACK OF A CROUCHING LION.

BOON COMPANIONS GATHER IN THE MINIATURE HALL. THEY CHATTER AND DRINK
WINE.... THEY STARE AT THE FLICKERING REFLECTIONS OF PEONIES THAT LINE
THE BANK. SOME OF THE COMPANIONS, LONG SLEEVES PUSHED BACK, CAPS LOW
OVER EYES, ARE WRITING POEMS.

THE ARCH OF THE BRIDGE IS A CRESCENT MOON.... THE REFLECTED PEONIES A
COMPANY OF DANCING GIRLS.

                           PICKING THE LOTUS


THE HARVEST MOON IS BURNING THE WATERS OF SOUTH LAKE. DRIFTING ALONE, I
LEAN DOWN TO PICK WHITE LOTUS LILIES.

FIERCE DESIRE PULLS ME.... I YEARN TO TELL THEM OF MY PASSION. ALAS, MY
BOAT FLOATS AWAY AT MERCY OF THE MOVING CURRENT. MY HEART LOOKS BACK IN
SADNESS.

                            A FLUTE AT NIGHT


HERE ON THE FAR SOUTHERN BORDER THE SAND BELOW THE MOUNTAIN LIES LIKE A
FIELD OF SNOW, THE MOONLIGHT IS LIKE FROST ALONG THE CITY-WALL. SOMEONE
SOMEWHERE PLAYING ON HIS FLUTE HAS MADE THE NORTHERN SOLDIERS HOMESICK
ALL NIGHT LONG.

                         WATCHING AND WONDERING


HIGH ON A HILL, LOOKING DOWN ON THE WINDY LAKE. SEE: A LITTLE ROCKING
BOAT, STORM-TOSSED LIKE OUR LIFE TOGETHER. NOW MIST HAS HIDDEN BOAT AND
JOURNEY.

OVER THE MIST THE SUN SETS FAR OFF IN HEAVEN. ONLY HILLS ARE RED: FIELD,
HOLLOW AND LAKE ARE BLUE WITH SHADOW.

NOW ISLANDS IN THE LAKE ARE BLACK PEARLS SET IN AMETHYST. NOW THAT
WOODED HILL, A HEAD OF WAVING WOMAN’S HAIR, IS BLACK. AND SEE, A
CRESCENT COMB OF SILVER MOON.

SAD AND HAPPY, I PICK UP MY LUTE AND SING UNTIL THE STARS GROW PALE.

                         BEST HAPPINESS OF ALL


I AM OLD AND I AM BORED. I WAS NEVER VERY WISE AND MY MIND HAS NEVER
WALKED MUCH FURTHER THAN MY FEET. ONLY MY FOREST, MY FOREST ... I GO
BACK AND BACK TO WANDER THERE.

THERE BLUE FINGERS OF THE MOON STILL PLAY ON MY OLD LUTE. THERE WIND
SCATTERS CLOUDS AND COMES DOWN TO FLUTTER MY ROBE.

YOU ASK ME WHAT IS THE BEST HAPPINESS OF ALL? IN THE FOREST IT IS SWEET
TO HEAR A GIRL SINGING ON THE PATH, AFTER SHE HAS STOPPED TO ASK HER
WAY, AND THANKED YOU WITH A SMILE.

                             THE BLUE ROBE


BRING ME NO MORE FLOWERS. BRING ME ONLY CYPRESS BOUGHS TO SHROUD MY
FACE.

AFTER SUNSET IN THE MOUNTAINS, I WILL PUT ON MY BLUE ROBE WITH LONG
SLEEVES, AND GO OUT TO SLEEP AMONG THE BAMBOOS THAT SHE LOVED.

                         THE ASHES OF MY HOUSE


WHEN I RETURNED TO THE HOUSE WHERE I HAD BEEN A HAPPY CHILD ... ONLY A
PILE OF ASHES WHERE IT HAD STOOD.

I WEPT LONG, AND TO FORGET MY WEEPING, I SAILED OUT ON THE VAST CALM
SEA. ON THESE WATERS, IN A STAR-SAPPHIRE NIGHT, I PLAYED MY FLUTE TO THE
SUMMER MOON ... MY GRIEF MY MELODY. BUT THE MOON, A WOMAN’S FACE, SOON
VEILED ITSELF WITH CLOUD.

I SAILED BACK TO SHORE, I WALKED AWAY FROM THE WATERS TO THE FRIENDLY
FOREST.... BUT THERE THE TREES TOO TURNED AWAY FROM ME. I KNEW THEN
HAPPINESS WAS BURNED FOREVER UNDER A PILE OF ASHES.

RUNNING BACK TO THE SEA, I DECIDED TO DROWN MYSELF. BUT A WHITE BOAT
SAILED ALONG THE SHORE. A YOUNG GIRL WAS SAILING IT.

O YOU WHO SMILED AT ME THAT DAY WHEN I WAS SUFFERING, O YOU WHO RESCUED
ME FROM GRIEF ... I WILL BUILD AGAIN THE HAPPY HOUSE OF MY CHILDHOOD, IN
YOUR HEART.

                            THE MAIDEN LO-FO


GOING TO GATHER LEAVES, LO-FO PUTS UP HER GLEAMING HAIR. SHE PUTS A
PEARL IN EACH PEARL EAR; SHE WEARS A DRESS OF PINK AND A DRESS OF
YELLOW. HER BASKET BEARS A LITTLE TWIST OF SILK.

ON THE SOUTH ROAD THE GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE CALLS TO HIS MEN TO STOP
THE HORSES. “ASK THAT PRETTY ONE HER NAME. FIND OUT HER AGE FOR ME.”

SAID LO-FO: “IN THE COUNTRYSIDE OF TSIN THERE LIVES A GIRL NAMED LO-FO.
SHE IS NOT TWENTY YET, BUT NEITHER IS SHE A CHILD, FOR SHE HAS PASSED
SIXTEEN.”

THE GOVERNOR HESITATES. “ASK THE LOVELY MAIDEN IF SHE WISHES TO COME
WITH ME IN MY CHARIOT.”

LO-FO LOWERS HER BLACK EYES. “SURELY THE GOVERNOR HAS A WIFE IN THE
SOUTH HE LOVES? SO EVEN IN TSIN, THE MAID LO-FO HAS HER YOUNG MAN WHOM
SHE HAS PROMISED, WHOM SHE LOVES.”
                                                           [_Anonymous_]




                           LOOKING INTO MIST


THE ASHES LIE CHILL AND GRAY IN THE GOLDEN BRAZIER. MY COVERLETS ROLL IN
RED WAVES AS I TOSS IN MY BED. I THROW THEM OFF AWAY FROM ME; THEY FLOAT
DOWN LIKE WAVES ON THE FLOOR. BUT I HAVE NO STRENGTH TO RISE AND BRUSH
OUT MY LONG HAIR; EVEN THE JADE COMB IS TOO HEAVY FOR MY HAND. LET THE
DUST SETTLE ON MY DRESSING-TABLE, DULLING MY GLEAMING BOTTLES.

NOW THE SUN BEGINS TO GLITTER THROUGH MY CURTAINS. ITS RISING WILL CAST
BITTER SHADOWS OF SORROW IN MY HEART. I WISH TO SPEAK, I WANT TO CRY
OUT; BUT FROM MY THROAT I CRUSH BACK MY CRIES INTO MY HEART. THIS IS NEW
FOR ME, PAIN WHICH COMES NOT FROM TOO MUCH WINE, NOR FROM THE SADNESS OF
APPROACHING AUTUMN.

NO, IT IS OVER NOW AND FINISHED. TODAY HE GOES AWAY. EVEN IF I SANG THE
SWEET STAY-BY-ME SONG TO HIM TEN THOUSAND TIMES, HE WOULD NOT STAY. MY
THOUGHTS MUST TRAVEL THE LONG ROAD TO THE SOUTH COUNTRY: HIS COUNTRY,
VERY FAR AWAY.

SEE THE MIST AROUND MY PAVILION: BEFORE MY EYES THERE IS MIST ALL ABOUT.
IT IS THE IMAGE OF MY SADNESS, THE REFLECTION OF MY DULL, STILL EYES.
FOREVER WILL MY DULL EYES STARE AT YOU, PALE MIST, MY EYES THAT NEVER
WILL LIGHT UP AGAIN.

                            THE WILLOW LEAF


THAT MAIDEN, DREAMING AT HER WINDOW-LEDGE, LEANING ON HER SOFT WHITE
ARMS ... I DO NOT LOVE HER FOR HER GREAT MANSION ON THE SHORE OF THE
YELLOW RIVER. I LOVE HER BECAUSE SHE HAS LET FALL, FLOATING DOWN INTO
THE STREAM, A LITTLE WILLOW LEAF.

I DO NOT LOVE THE EAST WIND BECAUSE IT CARRIES TO ME THE SCENT OF THOSE
PEACH-TREES THAT ARE LIKE SNOW ON THE MOUNTAINS. I LOVE IT BECAUSE IT
HAS CARRIED THE LITTLE WILLOW LEAF TO MY BOAT.

AND THE LITTLE WILLOW LEAF ... I DO NOT LOVE IT BECAUSE IT REMINDS ME
THAT SOFT SPRING HAS COME AGAIN. I LOVE IT BECAUSE THE DREAMING MAIDEN
HAS PICKED A NAME ON IT WITH HER NEEDLE, AND BECAUSE THAT NAME IS MINE.

                            AN UNHAPPY TIME


THE HOURS PASS.... THE PHOENIX FLIES AND FLIES FROM HOME. STARLINGS AND
SPARROWS BUILD THEIR NESTS IN THE ALTAR OF OUR ANCESTRAL HALL. MAGNOLIAS
REACH OUT THEIR TENDRILS.... THE JUNGLE SEIZES THEM, THEY PERISH
ENTANGLED. RANCID SMELLS DRIVE OUT SWEET FRAGRANCES. EVERYWHERE THE EVIL
PRINCIPLE HAS DISPOSSESSED THE GOOD.

THIS IS THE TIME OF BADNESS.... LOYAL, BUT IN DESPAIR, I BEGIN MY
JOURNEYS OF EXILE.

                          THE SHADOW OF A LEAF


ALONE IN HER ROOM A GIRL EMBROIDERS SILKEN FLOWERS. SHE HEARS A FLUTE
AFAR. SHE SHIVERS ... DREAMING A YOUNG MAN IS SINGING TO HER OF HIS
LOVE.

FROM THE SUNLIGHT SLANTING THROUGH THE PAPER WINDOW, THE SHADOW OF AN
ORANGE-LEAF FALLS ON HER BREAST. SHE CLOSES HER EYES ... DREAMING A
YOUNG MAN’S HAND IS OPENING HER ROBE.

YOUR LORDSHIP, I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE TWO PEARLS YOU OFFER ME, BUT I
TREMBLE WITH UNCERTAINTY. WHAT SHALL I SAY?... I SAY TO YOU: I AM
MARRIED AND HAVE SWORN TO BE FAITHFUL TO MY HUSBAND.

PERHAPS YOU DO NOT KNOW THAT THE COLORS OF MY FAMILY HANG IN THE ROYAL
PARK? PERHAPS YOU DO NOT KNOW THAT MY HUSBAND IS HONORARY LANCER IN THE
PALACE?

I THINK YOU ARE SINCERE; I THINK YOU ARE HONORABLE. THEREFORE I HAVE PUT
YOUR PEARLS AGAINST MY ROBE, AND I HAVE LOOKED AT THEM, AND SMILED. BUT
TAKE THEM NOW AGAIN. PERHAPS YOU WILL TAKE THESE TWO TEARS AS WELL?

AH, WHY DID I NOT KNOW YOU THREE YEARS AGO THIS SPRING?

                           THE EMPEROR WALKS


RECLINING IN THE GOLDEN CHAIR THE SON OF THE SKY IS BRIGHT AMONG HIS
COUNSELORS. HIS JEWELS SHINE.... HE IS FULL SUN WITHIN SURROUNDING
STARS. THE COUNSELORS SPEAK GRAVELY OF GRAVE THINGS, BUT THE EMPEROR’S
MIND IS AWAY, AWAY.

IN A PAVILION ALL PORCELAIN SHE SITS AMONG HER MAIDENS ... BRIGHT LILY
AMONG PLAIN LEAVES. HER FAN FLOATS BACK AND FORTH WEARILY LIKE A WAVING
LEAF. HER LORD STAYS TOO LONG AWAY.

PERFUME IS ON THE BREEZE ... AN OPEN WINDOW IN THE COUNCIL-ROOM. THE
EMPEROR DREAMS: SHE IS FANNING ME THE FLAVOR OF HER LIPS. HE RISES,
GLITTERING WITH JEWELS, AND SLOWLY WALKS, WALKS TO THE PORCELAIN
PAVILION. THE GRAVE COUNSELORS ARE LEFT, LOOKING AT EACH OTHER IN SUDDEN
SILENCE.

                             THE ENCOUNTER


THEY MET. THEIR EYES MET IN SHINING DUST AT THE CAPITAL. HE RAISED HIS
RIDING-CROP IN GOLDEN GREETING. “OF ALL THOSE TEN THOUSAND HOUSES BY THE
WILLOWED RIVER, FAIR SWEET LADY, WHICH IS THE LITTLE ONE YOU CALL HOME?”

                          THE BREATH OF SPRING


THE BREATH OF SPRING IS EVERYWHERE, IN EVERY FACE. THE MIMOSA CASTS ITS
DELICATE SHADOWS ... MY DREAMS ARE BUTTERFLIES ... THE FRAGRANCE OF THE
QUINCE INTOXICATES LIKE WINE.

BUT I PLUCK THE WILLOW OF SORROW. A GULF DIVIDES US, AND THERE IS NO
FAIRY BRIDGE OF BIRDS TO CARRY ME ACROSS.

I WEEP ALONE BEFORE MY SILVER LAMP AND GROW FRAIL AS HSIAO YAN THE
SLENDER BEAUTY. WHEN SHALL WE SHARE A NIGHT LIKE THIS, A SPRING NIGHT
LIKE THIS, AND MEET TOGETHER UNDER A FULL MOON?

                           JADE FLOWER PALACE


HERE BY THE WINDING STREAMLET, AMONG THE SIGHING WINDS, OLD GRAY MICE
SCURRY OVER THE ROOF-TILES. NO ONE ANY MORE REMEMBERS THE PRINCE’S NAME
WHO BUILT THIS PALACE UNDER OVERHANGING CLIFFS.

IN DARKENED ROOMS YOU CAN SEE GREEN GHOST FIRES ... FROM THE FLUTES OF
THE FOREST YOU CAN HEAR A THOUSAND VOICES. THE YOUNG PALACE LADIES OF
LONG AGO ARE IN THEIR YELLOW GRAVES ... THEN WHY ARE PAINTED SCROLLS
STILL HANGING ON THE WALL? THE CHARIOTEERS AND THEIR GOLD CHARIOTS ARE
CRUMBLED ... THEN WHY ARE STONE HORSES, CARVED IN OLDEN DAYS, STANDING
YET?

SADNESS SITS ON THE GRASS. I SING THE STORY, BUT I AM HEAVY WITH SORROW
... AMONG ALL THESE PATHS THAT WE MAY WALK ALONG INTO THE DISTANCE,

                          WINE-FLASK AT SUNSET


SPRING FRAGRANCES, AND LEVEL SUN-SHAFTS, COME SIFTING THROUGH MY
SHUTTERS. NOW COMES THE SUPPER-HOUR WHEN BOATMEN BOIL THEIR RICE ON THE
RIVER. IN THE GARDEN SPARROWS ARE TWITTERING ... ON THE ROAD A
CHARIOT-WHEEL IS GRATING.

NOW FOR THE WINE-FLASK. LET MY TROUBLES FLY AWAY ... JOINING THE INSECTS
A-BUZZ IN THE LATE-SUN GARDEN.

                         WHEN THE SUN ROSE ...


WHEN SHE WENT OUT TO MEET HER LOVER UNDER THE BIG WILLOW TREE BY THE
RIVER EDGE, SHE PUT ON TWO OF HER LOVELY ROBES TO PLEASE HIM.

WHEN THE SUN SANK BELOW THE HILLS, AND THE NIGHT WAS DARK, THE TWO
LOVERS STILL LAY THERE, TALKING TENDERLY TOGETHER.

SUDDENLY SHE ROSE TO HER FEET, ROSY WITH SHAME. HER THIRD ROBE, THE
DARKNESS UNDER THE WILLOW, HAD FALLEN OFF WITH DAWN....

                            GOING TO MARKET


THE LITTLE SERVANT-BOY ... TYING THE FEET OF THE CHICKEN HE WILL TAKE TO
MARKET. THE CHICKEN FLUTTERS IN HIS HANDS, AND SQUAWKS WITH FRIGHT.

MY FATHER STARES WITHOUT FEELINGS. MY MOTHER TURNS AWAY HER HEAD. A
SPARROW OVERHEAD IS ACTING SO DELIGHTED ... MAYBE SOME EXTRA GRAIN FOR
HIM?

                            LIKE A CORMORANT


THE CORMORANT STANDS STILL, THINKING, ALL ALONE AT THE RIVER’S EDGE. HIS
STARING EYE FOLLOWS THE CHANGING WATERS.

WHEN STROLLERS COME TOO CLOSE TO HIM, BALANCING HIS LONG NECK HE FLAPS
AWAY, WAITING IN THE TALL REEDS TILL THE INTRUDERS PASS ... WISHING TO
STARE AGAIN AT THE UNDULATIONS OF THE STREAM.

AND AT DUSK, WHEN THE MOON IS RIPPLING ON THE WAVES, THE CORMORANT STILL
STANDS, THINKING, WITH ONE FOOT IN THE CURRENT ... JUST SO A MAN, HIS
HEART BURNING WITH PASSION, STARES AT THE UNDULATIONS OF HIS DREAM.

SINGING TO THE MOON.

                               CAPTIVITY


IN THE OLD DAYS, IN THE PALACE HUNG WITH PAINTED SCROLLS, IT WAS A GOOD
LIFE FOR ME. INCENSE BURNED WHERE I WALKED, SILK CUSHIONS WERE SCATTERED
WHERE I SLEPT, MUSICIANS PLAYED ABOUT ME ... I LOOKED OUT ON GARDENS
WITH PATHS OF CORAL PEBBLES.

NOW, PRISONER IN THIS COLD FORTRESS, I HEAR ONLY FRIGHTENING CALLS FROM
THE WATCHMAN, SILLY CRIES FROM MONKEYS PLAYING ON BARE ROCKS IN
MOONLIGHT.

FEAR SHAKES ME. MY GUTS ARE EMPTIED OF COURAGE. IF ONLY I COULD SEE THE
LIGHTS OF THE CAPITAL! ... BUT ALL I CAN SEE ARE STARS ABOVE IT.

I SIT ON THE STONE FORTRESS WALL ... THERE, WINDS BRING SCENT OF ALMOND
BLOSSOMS FROM TREES BEYOND MY SIGHT.

ME, UP HERE ON THIS WATCH-TOWER.... HERE, AT THE SEA’S EDGE, WE CAN
WATCH GRAY CLOUDS TORN BY WINDS, AND BE SAD TOGETHER NOW AUTUMN HAS
RETURNED.

EARTH HAS SWALLOWED THE SNOW. AGAIN WE SEE PLUM-TREES IN BLOSSOM. NEW
WILLOW-LEAVES ARE GOLD. COLD WATERS OF THE LAKE ARE SILVER....
BUTTERFLIES POWDERED WITH GOLD LAY VELVET HEADS TO THE HEARTS OF
FLOWERS.

IN HIS UNMOVING BOAT THE YOUNG FISHERMAN PULLS UP HIS DRIPPING NET,
MAKING RIPPLES ON THE STILL WATER.

HE THINKS OF A GIRL AT HOME, LIKE A DARK SWALLOW IN ITS NEST. HE THINKS
OF A GIRL AT HOME, WAITING LIKE A DARK SWALLOW FOR HER MATE.

TIME, YOUR HAIR AND MY HAIR WILL TURN WHITE LIKE SNOW, WHITE LIKE A
MIDSUMMER MOON.” TODAY, MY LORD, I HAVE HEARD THAT YOU LOVE ANOTHER
WOMAN.... WITH MY HEART BROKEN I COME TO SAY GOODBYE.

ONE LAST TIME LET US POUR THE OLD WINE INTO OUR TWO CUPS. ONE LAST TIME
LET YOU SING ME THE SAD SONG OF THE DEAD BIRD UNDER THE SNOW.... THEN I
WILL TAKE BOAT AND SAIL DOWN THE RIVER YU CHEU, WHOSE WATERS DIVIDE TO
FLOW HALF EAST, HALF WEST.

WHY DO YOU CRY, YOUNG GIRLS ABOUT TO MARRY? WHY DO YOU CRY? PERHAPS YOU

THE TALL CRANE WALKED OUT OF THE POOL AND STOOD ON THE FLIGHT OF STEPS.
THE MOON DANCED OUT OF THE POOL AND ENTERED THE OPEN DOOR.

I WAS ENTRANCED BY THIS PLACE ... I COULD NOT LEAVE FOR TWO NIGHTS.

FORTUNATE TO FIND A PLACE SO PEACEFUL.... HAPPY NO COMPANION WAS THERE
TO DRAG ME HOME!

NOW I HAVE FOUND THIS PEACEFUL LONELINESS, I HAVE RESOLVED TO COME HERE

THEIR SCENT. I THINK OF MY LOVELY GIRL. I MUST LEAVE HER, BUT I CAN NOT
FORGET.

I AM ROWED ACROSS THE RIVER ON MY PLEASURE BARGE, ACROSS THE RIVER WITH
WHITE WAVES RISING. FLUTE AND DRUM AND ROWERS’ SONG GO WITH ME. NOW THE
FEASTING, NOW THE DANCING ... BUT STILL MY HEART IS SAD AND WILL NOT
DANCE.

THE EMPEROR’S SOLDIERS MARCH DOWN WHITE MOUND ROAD. TARTARS SEARCH THE

TWISTED PINE-BRANCH; THE LITTLE BROOK SINGS COLD, AND THE COLD WIND
SIGHS; THE WOOD CUTTERS ALL HAVE CARRIED THEIR BUNDLES HOME; THE

                           THE WIND-TORN ROOF


IN THE EIGHTH-MOON OF AUTUMN, WITH A VICIOUS HOWLING, WIND TORE THREE
LAYERS OF THATCH FROM MY POOR ROOF.

FLYING OVER THE RIVER THE THATCH RAINED ON THE EMBANKMENT, TANGLED IN
THE TREES, WHIRLED AFAR TO SINK AND SETTLE IN THE MARSHES.

A SWARM OF BOYS FROM THE VILLAGE LAUGHED AT ME BECAUSE I AM FEEBLE. O
INSOLENCE! STEALING MY THATCH AND CARRYING IT OFF TO PLAY WITH IN THE
BAMBOO GROVE! I SCREAMED AT THEM WITH A DRY TONGUE ... BUT THEY LAUGHED
AT ME AND I CAME HOME SIGHING.

THEN THE WIND STOPPED, THE CLOUDS TURNED DARK, AND NIGHT CAME ON LIKE
INK. MY OLD COTTON QUILT WAS COLD AS IRON ... MY SWEET SON TOSSED IN HIS
SLEEP, BARE FEET STICKING THROUGH THE BLANKET ... RAIN CAME THROUGH THE
ROOF TILL THERE WAS NOT A DRY INCH IN BED.

LIKE STRINGS OF WAX THE RAIN HUNG DOWN ... ALL THESE DISASTERS OF WAR
HANG DOWN AND KEEP US FROM PEACEFUL REST.

I DREAM OF A GREAT HOUSE WITH TEN THOUSAND ROOMS. THERE ALL COLD
CREATURES CAN TAKE SHELTER, WITH BRIGHT FACES, OUT OF THE RAIN, OUT OF
THE WIND, SAFE IN A HOUSE SOLID AS A MOUNTAIN.

AH, WHEN SHALL I EVER SEE SUCH A HOUSE? COULD I EVER SEE IT ... AH,
THOUGH THE WIND TORE DOWN MY HUT ENTIRELY, THOUGH I FROZE TO DEATH IN
THE STORM, THEN SHOULD I DIE HAPPY.

A FRESHLY-OPENED CHERRY BUD ... HER LIPS UPON THE FLUTE. SHE LEANS IN
THE CORNER OF THE BALCONY: THE NIGHT IS CHILL, HER SILKEN ROBES ARE
THIN, HER FINGERS COLD ... BUT MUSIC FLOATS THROUGH FROSTY WOODS AND
STARTLED PLUMS FALL PATTERING DOWN.

THE TRUMPETS SUMMON THE WARRIORS! THEY WILL RIDE ON TILL THEY COME TO

THERE, ONLY THE COLD BARE MOON. ONLY COLD BEADS OF DEW ON SWORDS AND

THAT NIGHT ... A NIGHT IN EARLY AUTUMN ... WE SAILED TO THE ISLE OF
PARROTS. THERE WE GAZED AT THE ROUND MOON, AND LISTENED TO THE WINDY
PINES.

SUDDENLY WE HEARD MUSIC ... A SAD SONG COMING ON THE WIND. THERE WAS A
SINGER IN A BOAT.

AS IT DREW NEAR US WE SAW A WOMAN, WHITE AS SNOW, SINGING AND CRYING
TOO, LEANING ON THE MAST. MY COMPANIONS ASKED HER WHY SHE WEPT?...
WITHOUT AN ANSWER SHE LOWERED HER HEAD, VEILING HER WHITE FACE IN HER
GOLDEN HAIR.

IF MINE WAS JUDGED THE BEST ... YOU SEE, THERE WAS A VISION OF YOU, A
VISION IN BLUE VEILS, IN THE BLUE DAWN WHEN I COULD NOT SLEEP. SO I GOT
UP FROM BED AND WROTE THE POEM FOR YOU ...

BUT YOU SLEPT ON UNKNOWING IN THAT EARLY DAWN. YOU DID NOT PEEP OUT FROM
THE JADE FLOWER PAVILION TO SEE ROSES BLOOMING IN THE SKY ABOVE THE
PALACE. IN THAT SAME PALACE ONCE, FOR LOVE OF HER, WOU-TI MADE EMPRESS A
LOVELY DANCING-GIRL LIKE YOU.

OUR GAIETY AND WIT? LET US SIT INDOORS.

NOW IS THE TIME FOR POETRY THAT REMEMBERS SUMMER. LET IT BE PUT DOWN

OFF LIKE CLOUDS OR SMOKE: TIME PAST ESCAPES FROM US QUICKER THAN A
FLIGHT OF BIRDS.
                                                               [_Tu Fu_]




                        LAUGHTER IN THE THICKET


THE GAY AND GALLANT YOUTH ... HIS PALACE IS ON THE ROAD OF IMPERIAL
TOMBS NEAR THE GOLDEN BAZAAR ... SETS OUT INTO THE SWEET SPRING BREEZE.

HIS TALL WHITE CHARGER, SADDLED WITH SILVER, PRANCES GRACEFULLY IN
RHYTHMIC STEPS. BENEATH HIM IS A WHIRLWIND OF PETALS AS HE RIDES THROUGH
THE CARPET OF FALLEN BLOSSOMS.

THE YOUTH REINS IN THE CHARGER, PERPLEXED.... A LAUGH, SWEET AND
MUSICAL, RINGS FROM THE THICKET; NOW HE IS PERPLEXED NO MORE.
                                                               [_Li Po_]




                             SEEING YOU OFF


BECAUSE YOU ARE OLD, BECAUSE YOU ARE LEAVING, MY HANDKERCHIEF IS WET
WITH TEARS ... BECAUSE YOU ARE SEVENTY YEARS OLD AND HAVE NO HOME.

I AM UNEASY AS THE WIND RISES AND YOUR BOAT SAILS OFF ... WHITE-HEADED
TRAVELER AMONG WHITE-HEADED WAVES.
                                                            [_Po Chu-i_]




                             A LETTER HOME


YOU ASK ME: WHEN WILL I COME HOME? THERE IS NO DATE SETTLED YET. HERE,
AT PA-SHAN IN AUTUMN, EVENING RAIN FLOODS THE HOLLOWS.

O FOR THE TIME WHEN WE CAN PUT OUT THE CANDLE TOGETHER BY THE WESTERN
WINDOW ... O FOR THE TIME WHEN I CAN TELL YOU HOW I FEEL HERE TONIGHT AT
PA-SHAN, WHEN AUTUMN RAIN FLOODS THE HOLLOWS.
                                                        [_Li-Shang-yin_]




                         THE POET AND THE FLOOD


ICY WINDS SWEEP DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS AND RIP OUT THE TREES. PITILESS,
THE FLOOD RISES IN THE RIVER DAY BY DAY. THERE IS NO MOUNTAIN NOW, OR
FIELDS ... EVERYTHING IS FOG AND WATER.

ALL THE SAME, MY LATE CHRYSANTHEMUMS ARE IN BLOOM. WHEN YOU ROW PAST,
YUNG-HI, SLOW YOUR BOAT IN FRONT OF MY GARDEN AND GAZE AT THEM ... THEIR
HOT COLORS WILL RE-WARM YOUR HEART.
                                                               [_Tu Fu_]




                           PARTING IN AUTUMN


THE CRICKETS ARE COLD, THEIR SONG IS SAD. OUTSIDE THE PAVILION THE LAST
SHOWER-DROPS PATTER DOWN. HOLLOW THE HAPPY FAREWELL PARTY. WE LINGER ...
WHILE THE RIVER-BOAT, LOADED WITH SANDALWOOD, IS WAITING FOR ME TO GO
ABOARD.

WE STAND HAND IN HAND, WE STAND WITHOUT TALKING, WE STAND WITH TEARS ...
TO THINK THAT I MUST TRAVEL A THOUSAND MILES OF MIST AND RAIN AND WATER!
THE EVENING CLOUDS ARE GATHERING AGAIN, AND THE SKY WIDENS TO THE SOUTH.

IT IS AN OLD STORY: PARTING FROM A LOVER IS FULL OF PAIN ... AND IT IS
ALL THE WORSE IN RAINY AUTUMN. TONIGHT, WHEN I GROW SOBER AFTER ALL THIS
WINE, WHERE WILL YOU BE? ON THE WILLOWY SHORE, UNDER THE WANING MOON?

AND I ... ALL THIS YEAR AWAY, SUNSHINE AND LOVELY SIGHTS WILL COME TO ME
IN VAIN ... NO ONE ALL THIS YEAR TO TELL A THOUSAND HAPPY THOUGHTS.
                                                             [_Li Yung_]




                             THE EMBROIDERY


THE COOL WIND OF EVENING BLOWS BIRD-SONG TO A WINDOW WHERE THE MAIDEN
SITS. SHE IS EMBROIDERING FLOWER-PATTERNS ON SILK.

HER HEAD IS RAISED; HER WORK FALLS FROM HER FINGERS; HER THOUGHTS HAVE
FLOWN TO SOMEONE FAR AWAY.

“A BIRD CAN EASILY FIND ITS MATE AMONG THE LEAVES, BUT ALL A MAIDEN’S
TEARS, FALLING LIKE RAIN FROM HEAVEN, WILL NOT BRING BACK HER DISTANT
LOVER.”

SHE BENDS AGAIN TO HER EMBROIDERY: “I WILL WEAVE A LITTLE VERSE AMONG
THESE FLOWERS OF HIS ROBE ... PERHAPS HE WILL READ IT AND COME BACK
AGAIN.”
                                                               [_Li Po_]




                             THE SOUTH WIND


THE SWEET SMELL OF THE SOUTH WIND CAN CALM THE TEMPERS OF MY PEOPLE.

THE SWEET RAIN OF THE SOUTH WIND CAN NOURISH THE GRAIN-FIELDS OF MY
PEOPLE.
                                                           [_Anonymous_]




                           LET US DRINK WINE


LOOK: DO YOU NOT SEE THE RAIN FALLING AT LAST FROM THE SKY? FALLING INTO
THE YELLOW RIVER, FLOWING FAST INTO THE SEA, AND NEVER NEVER RETURNING?

LOOK: DO YOU NOT SEE THE CLEAR MIRROR IN THE HALL, SHOWING OUR HAIR
BLACK SILK AT MORNING, FALLEN TO BITTER SNOW BY NIGHT?

YOU WHO HAVE HAD YOUR FILL OF BITTER LIFE, COME DRINK THE DREGS WITH ME!
LET THERE BE MOONLIGHT IN OUR EVENING ... LET THE GOLDEN CUPS NEVER
STAND EMPTY.

HEAVEN BLESSED ME WITH RICHES AND I MUST SPEND MYSELF. THOUGH I THROW
AWAY TEN THOUSAND GOLD COINS AND POEMS, ALWAYS I FIND MORE. SO LET US
SLAUGHTER THE SHEEP AND THE OX ... LET US MAKE MERRY AND MERRY ... WHY,
I PROMISE TO SWALLOW THREE HUNDRED CUPS THIS SINGLE NIGHT.

COME, FRIEND CH’IN ... COME, MASTER CH’AN ... I OFFER YOU MY WINE: DO
NOT REFUSE IT. I OFFER YOU MY SONG: DO NOT IGNORE IT.

THE MEATS AND THE DANCING AND THE MUSIC ARE NOT MY DESIRE ... MY ONLY
DESIRE IS TO BE DRUNK FOR EVER AND EVER AND NEVER WAKE AGAIN. SCHOLARS
AND SAINTS ARE FORGOTTEN SOON; BUT GREAT DRUNKARDS ARE IMMORTAL.

THEY SAY PRINCE CH’EN AT HIS GREAT PING-YUEH TEMPLE FEAST PAID TEN
THOUSAND COINS FOR WINE, SO EVERYONE COULD HAVE ENOUGH. NOW THAT I GIVE
THE FEAST ... DARE I LACK MONEY? NO! LET US BUY THE WINE! LET US DRINK
TOGETHER! I WILL SEND MY BOY WITH MY FIVE-COLORED HORSE, I WILL SEND MY
BOY WITH MY WONDROUS FURS WORTH ALONE TEN THOUSAND COINS ... HE WILL
BARTER THEM FOR WINE ... AND WE, WE WILL DROWN THE SORROW OF A THOUSAND
GENERATIONS!
                                                               [_Li Po_]




                              AT THE RIVER


SHE GATHERS LILY-FLOWERS IN THE SHALLOW RIVER-WATERS ... SINGING AS SHE
WADES. NOW A STRANGER DAWDLES ALONG THE BANK. SHE TURNS AROUND TO LOOK
AT HIM.

HIDING IN A BUNCH OF LILIES, PRETENDING TO BE EMBARRASSED ... SHE PEEKS
OUT TO SMILE.
                                                               [_Li Po_]




                             CHRYSANTHEMUMS


I BUILT MY LITTLE HOUSE RIGHT IN THE CITY, BUT I NEVER HEAR HORSE OR
CARRIAGE. DO YOU WONDER HOW THIS CAN BE? BECAUSE A SOUL UNATTACHED
CREATES ITS OWN SWEET SOLITUDE.

I PICK CHRYSANTHEMUMS UNDER THE HEDGE TO THE EAST, GAZE AT THE MOUNTAIN
RISING TO THE SOUTH, BREATHE HIGH WESTERN AIR AT SUNSET, WATCH THE BIRDS
FLY NORTH.

THESE THINGS HOLD HIDDEN TRUTHS ... BUT WHEN I TRY TO UNCOVER THEM,
WORDS ARE NOT THE WAY.
                                                       [_Tao Yuan-Ming_]




                             THE INSTRUMENT


I SET MY STRINGED INSTRUMENT HERE ON THE ELEGANT TABLE ... I SIT HERE ON
THE EXQUISITE BENCH. EMOTIONS FLOW INTO ME, MOVE ME, AS I SIT HERE
QUIETLY.

WHY SHOULD I PLAY? BREEZES WILL FIND THE INSTRUMENT ... BREEZES WILL
FLOW OVER IT AND SWEEP THE STRINGS TO SONG.
                                                            [_Po Chu-i_]




                             A DREAM OF YOU


FOR TEN YEARS I HAVE BEEN LIVING AND YOU HAVE BEEN DEAD. EVEN WHEN I DO
NOT THINK OF YOU I CANNOT FORGET. YOUR LONELY GRAVE IS A THOUSAND MILES
AWAY.... WHERE CAN I GO TO SPEAK MY SADNESS?

EVEN IF WE MET NOW, YOU WOULD NEVER RECOGNIZE ME. MY HAIR IS GOING GRAY
AT THE TEMPLES, MY WRINKLED FACE ALWAYS COVERED WITH DUST OF THE ROAD.

IN A DREAM LAST NIGHT I CAME HOME. AT THE OPEN WINDOW OF OUR ROOM YOU
SAT COMBING YOUR HAIR. WE STARED AT EACH OTHER WITHOUT A WORD, AND BURST
INTO TEARS.... I CHERISH IN MEMORY THAT GLEN OF OUR HEART-BREAKING, THAT
STILL MOONLIGHT NIGHT, THAT HILL OF LITTLE PINES.
                                                             [_Su Shih_]




                            A SONG OUT THERE


A SONG OUT THERE.... WHY, IT IS A BEGGAR SINGING! IF THIS OLD MAN WHO
NEVER HAD A SILVER COIN CAN SING, WHY MUST YOU WITH RICH GOLD MEMORIES
SIT HERE AND SIGH?
                                                               [_Tu Fu_]




                         THINKING OF HER LOVER


THE FRAGRANCE IS BLOWN FROM THE LOTUS-FLOWERS. THE EMERALD LEAVES ARE
WITHERED NOW AND BROWN. THE WEST WIND IS PUFFING SORROWS INTO GREEN
RIPPLES ON THE RIVER. EVERYTHING IS DYING, MY YEARS ARE DYING ... I
CANNOT BEAR THE SIGHT OF DEATH.

I STARE AT THE SILKEN LINES OF RAIN, WHERE MY DREAMS ARE FLOATING IN THE
LOST LANDS OF NEVERMORE. ALONE I BLOW ON MY FLUTE OF JADE, UNTIL MY
BALCONY FREEZES WITH THE ICY NOTES. O ENDLESS SORROWS, ENDLESS TEARS,
ENDLESS LEANING ON MY EMPTY BALCONY.
                                                      [_Prince Li Chin_]




                              AUTUMN MOON


THE JADE STAIRCASE WEEPS WITH DEW. IT WETS HER SILKEN SHOES, AS SHE
CLIMBS SLOWLY TO THE PAVILION.

SHE TOO WEEPS. LETTING DOWN A CURTAIN OF CRYSTAL BEADS LIKE A TINKLING
WATERFALL, SHE SITS STARING THROUGH IT AT THE AUTUMN MOON.
                                                               [_Li Po_]




                             LI-SI DANCING


IN THE IMPERIAL GARDEN BREEZES TOY WITH OPENING LOTUS BLOSSOMS. ON THE
TERRACE, LYING ON SILK CUSHIONS SCATTERED THERE, THE KING LIES RESTING.

MORE DELICATE THAN A THIN SCARF OF MIST, BRIGHTER THAN THE EASTERN STAR,
LI-SI THE BEAUTY, THE FAVORITE, DANCES FOR THE KING.

ALL TREMULOUS EYELIDS AND TREMBLING LIMBS, SHE CIRCLES AND DROPS BESIDE
THE KING ... UNDER THE ROYAL EYE, HER LIDS ARE LOWERED.
                                                               [_Li Po_]




                              REFLECTIONS


RAPIDLY TONIGHT MY BOAT FLOATS DOWN THE RIVER UNDER A CLOUD-DAPPLED SKY.
I LOOK INTO THE WATER; IT IS AS CLEAR AS THE NIGHT. WHEN CLOUDS FLOAT
PAST THE MOON, I SEE THEM FLOATING IN THE RIVER, AND FEEL I AM ROWING IN
THE SKY.

I THINK OF MY LOVE ... MIRRORED SO IN MY HEART.
                                                               [_Tu Fu_]




                              AT MIDNIGHT


LOOK: MOONLIGHT SHINING ON MY BED. OR IS IT THE WHITE OF FROST?

RAISING MY HEAD, I SEE THE MOON OVER MOUNTAINS. LOWERING IT, I REMEMBER
ALL MY DEBTS AND ERRORS.
                                                               [_Li Po_]




                                AN ELEGY


LAST, BEST-LOVED DAUGHTER OF OLD HSIEH, YOU WHO FOOLISHLY RAN OFF WITH
THAT PENNILESS BOY, WHO MENDED HIS CLOTHES WITH PATCHES FROM YOUR OLD
CLOTHES BROUGHT FROM HOME ... AND I TEASED YOU FOR YOUR GOLD HAIRPINS,
SO WE COULD TRADE FOR WINE, AND WE DRANK IT WITH OUR DINNERS OF BERRIES
AND HERBS PICKED CHEAP IN THE FIELD, COOKED OVER DRY LEAVES FROM THE
FIELD ... NOW, WHEN THEY PAY ME WELL, ALL I CAN GIVE BACK TO YOU IS
TEMPLE OFFERINGS.

LONG LONG AGO WE COULD LAUGH AT DYING, BUT DEATH A MAGICIAN CLOSED YOU
IN HIS HAND AND OPENED IT SUDDENLY EMPTY. I HAVE LOCKED YOUR NEEDLEWORK
AWAY, I HAVE GIVEN YOUR CLOTHES AWAY ... MY EYES ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH.
I AM GENTLE, BECAUSE YOU WERE, TO OUR SERVING-MAIDS AND MEN. SOMETIMES
WHEN I DREAM I DREAM I SHOWER YOU WITH GIFTS. ALL OF US MUST KNOW SUCH
SORROW ... TO KNOW IT BEST YOU MUST FIRST BE POOR AND HAPPY TOGETHER.

HERE I SIT ALONE, HERE I SIGH FOR BOTH OF US. HOW MANY BEADS MUST I
STILL COUNT UPON MY STRING OF TIME? BETTER MEN THAN I HAVE GROWN OLD
WITHOUT A SON ... A BETTER POET SANG TO HIS DEAD WIFE WHO COULD NOT
HEAR.

WE NEVER SAID THAT WE WOULD MEET AGAIN IN DEATH. I HAVE NO HOPE BEYOND
THE DARKNESS. ALL I HAVE, IS TO STARE INTO THE NIGHT, SEEING AGAIN AND
AGAIN THAT LITTLE WORRIED WRINKLE IN YOUR BROW.
                                                           [_Yuan Chen_]
