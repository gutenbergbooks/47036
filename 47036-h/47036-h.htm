<h2 id="c83">THINKING OF HER LOVER</h2>
<p><span class="smaller">THE FRAGRANCE IS BLOWN FROM THE LOTUS-FLOWERS.
THE EMERALD LEAVES ARE WITHERED
NOW AND BROWN. THE WEST WIND IS PUFFING
SORROWS INTO GREEN RIPPLES ON THE RIVER.
EVERYTHING IS DYING, MY YEARS ARE DYING ...
I CANNOT BEAR THE SIGHT OF DEATH.</span></p>
<p><span class="smaller">I STARE AT THE SILKEN LINES OF RAIN, WHERE
MY DREAMS ARE FLOATING IN THE LOST LANDS
OF NEVERMORE. ALONE I BLOW ON MY FLUTE OF
JADE, UNTIL MY BALCONY FREEZES WITH THE
ICY NOTES. O ENDLESS SORROWS, ENDLESS TEARS,
ENDLESS LEANING ON MY EMPTY BALCONY.

<p><span class="smaller">THE JADE STAIRCASE WEEPS WITH DEW. IT WETS
HER SILKEN SHOES, AS SHE CLIMBS SLOWLY TO
THE PAVILION.</span></p>
<p><span class="smaller">SHE TOO WEEPS. LETTING DOWN A CURTAIN OF
CRYSTAL BEADS LIKE A TINKLING WATERFALL,
SHE SITS STARING THROUGH IT AT THE AUTUMN
MOON.

<p><span class="smaller">IN THE IMPERIAL GARDEN BREEZES TOY WITH
OPENING LOTUS BLOSSOMS. ON THE TERRACE,
LYING ON SILK CUSHIONS SCATTERED THERE,
THE KING LIES RESTING.</span></p>
<p><span class="smaller">MORE DELICATE THAN A THIN SCARF OF MIST,
BRIGHTER THAN THE EASTERN STAR, LI-SI THE
BEAUTY, THE FAVORITE, DANCES FOR THE KING.</span></p>
<p><span class="smaller">ALL TREMULOUS EYELIDS AND TREMBLING LIMBS,
SHE CIRCLES AND DROPS BESIDE THE KING ...
UNDER THE ROYAL EYE, HER LIDS ARE LOWERED.

<p><span class="smaller">RAPIDLY TONIGHT MY BOAT FLOATS DOWN THE
RIVER UNDER A CLOUD-DAPPLED SKY. I LOOK
INTO THE WATER; IT IS AS CLEAR AS THE NIGHT.
WHEN CLOUDS FLOAT PAST THE MOON, I SEE
THEM FLOATING IN THE RIVER, AND FEEL I AM
ROWING IN THE SKY.</span></p>
<p><span class="smaller">I THINK OF MY LOVE ... MIRRORED SO IN MY
HEART.

<p><span class="smaller">LOOK: MOONLIGHT SHINING ON MY BED. OR IS
IT THE WHITE OF FROST?</span></p>
<p><span class="smaller">RAISING MY HEAD, I SEE THE MOON OVER MOUNTAINS.
LOWERING IT, I REMEMBER ALL MY DEBTS
AND ERRORS.

<h2 id="c88">AN ELEGY</h2>
<p><span class="smaller">LAST, BEST-LOVED DAUGHTER OF OLD HSIEH,
YOU WHO FOOLISHLY RAN OFF WITH THAT PENNILESS
BOY, WHO MENDED HIS CLOTHES WITH
PATCHES FROM YOUR OLD CLOTHES BROUGHT
FROM HOME ... AND I TEASED YOU FOR YOUR
GOLD HAIRPINS, SO WE COULD TRADE FOR WINE,
AND WE DRANK IT WITH OUR DINNERS OF BERRIES
AND HERBS PICKED CHEAP IN THE FIELD, COOKED
OVER DRY LEAVES FROM THE FIELD ... NOW,
WHEN THEY PAY ME WELL, ALL I CAN GIVE BACK
TO YOU IS TEMPLE OFFERINGS.</span></p>
<p><span class="smaller">LONG LONG AGO WE COULD LAUGH AT DYING, BUT
DEATH A MAGICIAN CLOSED YOU IN HIS HAND AND
OPENED IT SUDDENLY EMPTY. I HAVE LOCKED
YOUR NEEDLEWORK AWAY, I HAVE GIVEN YOUR
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
CLOTHES AWAY ... MY EYES ARE NOT STRONG
ENOUGH. I AM GENTLE, BECAUSE YOU WERE, TO
OUR SERVING-MAIDS AND MEN. SOMETIMES WHEN
I DREAM I DREAM I SHOWER YOU WITH GIFTS. ALL
OF US MUST KNOW SUCH SORROW ... TO KNOW
IT BEST YOU MUST FIRST BE POOR AND HAPPY
TOGETHER.</span></p>
<p><span class="smaller">HERE I SIT ALONE, HERE I SIGH FOR BOTH OF US.
HOW MANY BEADS MUST I STILL COUNT UPON
MY STRING OF TIME? BETTER MEN THAN I HAVE
GROWN OLD WITHOUT A SON ... A BETTER POET
SANG TO HIS DEAD WIFE WHO COULD NOT HEAR.</span></p>
<p><span class="smaller">WE NEVER SAID THAT WE WOULD MEET AGAIN IN
DEATH. I HAVE NO HOPE BEYOND THE DARKNESS.
ALL I HAVE, IS TO STARE INTO THE NIGHT, SEEING
AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT LITTLE WORRIED
WRINKLE IN YOUR BROW.
